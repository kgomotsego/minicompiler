    <h2>World of Modern compilers</h2>
    
    <p class="paragraph">"This is product of the Braze company developed M.K. Africa and K.F. Josephs.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">MJ Blue was also involved at a later stage of the development. </p>
    <p class="paragraph">The language dominating in the mini compiler is pascal.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Basic assembly x86 was included in some of the procedures.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The mini compiler was inspired by the great Julian Pareshki</p>
    <p class="paragraph">from France who built the first open-Source compiler.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The Braze Mini Compiler is also open-source"</p>

        <p>The procedure GetChar allows the program to read new character from the input stream.</p>
        <p>The procedure Error will check the data type in its argument, if the data type</p>
        <p>entered is not a string then the program will display an error. The Abort procedure </p>
        <p>stops the current processing once the error is found.</p>

        <p>The procedure Expected reports what was expected. The Match procedure will match the</p>
        <p>specific input character to the program. The function IsAlpha will allow the program</p>
        <p>to recognize uppercase characters. The function IsDigit will allow the program to recognize digits.

        <p>In the function GetName ,the condition statement ” if not IsDigit(Look) then Expected</p>
        <p>    (‘Name’) “ tells the user to enter a digit and <p>if not then the program will tell </p>
        <p>    the user that a name is expected. In the function GetName, the condition statement “if </p>
        <p>   not IsDigit(Look) then Expected (‘Integer’) tells the user to enter a digit and if </p>
        <p>  not then the program will tell the user that an integer is expected.  The procedure </p>
        <p>  Emit produces an output string without moving the cursor to the next line. The </p>
        <p>  procedure EmitLn will produce an output string and move the cursor to the next line. </p>

        <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4</strong></p> 
        <p>    In the procedure Term, the functions Match ( ‘(‘ ) and Match ( ‘)‘ ) have been added to</p> 
        <p>    enable the program to recognize parentheses in an expression. In the procedure Add, </p>
        <p>    procedure Match is called to look for “+” in any expression that may be input. Procedure</p>
        <p>    Term then moves the first digit to D0 and the procedure expression moves contents of</p>
        <p>    register D0 to D1. The Add procedure will then add the contents of registers D1 and D0 </p>
        <p>    where the D1 contains the second number to be added. In the procedure Subtract, </p>
        <p>    procedure Match is called to look for “-” in any expression that may be input. </p>
        <p>    Procedure Term then moves the first digit to D0 and the procedure expression moves</p>
        <p>    contents of register D0 to D1. The Subtract procedure will then add the contents of</p>
        <p>    registers D1 and D0 where the D1 contains the second number to be subtracted. </p>

        <p align="center"><strong>Figure 5</strong></p>
        <p>In the procedure Divide, procedure Match is called to look for “/” in any expression</p>
        <p>    that may be input. Procedure Term then moves the first digit to D0 and the procedure </p>
        <p>    expression moves contents of register D0 to D1. The following digit after the division </p>
        <p>    operator is then moved to D1 and the procedure Divide finally divides the contents of </p>
        <p>    register D1 by the contents of register D0. In the procedure Multiply, procedure  </p>
        <p>    is called to look for “*” in any expression that may be input. The procedure Term will </p>
        <p>    move the first recognized digit to register D0, the Multiply procedure will then multiply </p>
        <p>    the contents of registers D1 and D0 where the D1 contains the second number to be </p>
        <p>    multiplied. The procedure Expression can recognize math operators and call necessary </p>
        <p>    procedures (line 176-179) for recognition and translation of general expressions. The </p>
        <p>    procedure Expression contains a loop structure (line 173) which allows the procedure to </p>
        <p>    check for more than one math operator. The procedure only recognizes +, -, * and / </p>
        <p>    (line 173) since their procedures are defined as shown in figures 4 and 5. The procedure </p>
        <p>    has a line of code that that will send an error message when no math operator is </p>
        <p>    not found (Line 180).
